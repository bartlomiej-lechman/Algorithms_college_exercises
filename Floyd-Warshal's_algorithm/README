Implementation of Floyd and Warshal's algorithm. The output matrix should be read that way: the row number is the start node and the
column number is the destination node. The values in the matrix represents total cost to travel from one node to the second. For
example, the value under coordinates [0][5] means distance between nodes from 0 to 5. Number 999999 means that the destination node
is unreachable from the start node.
